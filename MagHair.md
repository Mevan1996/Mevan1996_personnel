# MagHair

This is a wearable system to create unique tactile feedback by stimulating only the body hair using controlled magnetic fields.The long-term goal of this project is to develop a mechanism which is capable of providing notifications to people with visual and auditory impairments. I contributed by developping the algorithm to control the magnetic fields with minimum power consumption. We built the initial prototype which was able to generate smooth and distinguishable skin sensations.
