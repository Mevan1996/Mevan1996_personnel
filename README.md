## Mevan Niluminda Wijewadena

My name is Mevan Niluminda Wijewardena. Currently I am working as Junior Lecturer in the Department of Electonic and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. 

I have a strong affinity towards mathematics and I am highly inspired by its applications in real-world scenarios. Due to my passion towards applied statistics and probability, I am keen on contributing to the development of theoretical frameworks which lie in the intersection of statistical machine learning, statistical signal processing, communications and information theory. I also have a passion towards discrete mathematics, specifically number theory and combinatorics.

I obtained my bachelors degree from the Department of Electonic and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, where I ranked 5th among 117 students. I completed my research project titled "Physical Layer Security for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Two–Way Communications" under the supervision of Dr. Tharaka Samarasinghe, Dr. Kasun Hemachandra, Dr. Saman Atapattu and Prof. Jamie Evans. My final year project was based on using machine learning for Non-intrusive Load Monitoring to reuduce the houselhold electricity wastage. 

I was a visiting student in Augmented Human Lab, University of Auckaland, New Zealand, where I wroked under the supervision of Prof. Suranga Nanayakkara. There, I contributed to two resarch projects mainly based on machine learning and electromagnetism.
