# Automated Shade Net

A shade net setup for orchid plantations, where humidity and temperature are measured and controlled automatically. Implementing green houses is costly and is unaffordable to most of the Sri Lankan orchid cultivators. Hence, our group focused on developing a low cost solution. I developed the algorithm for the temperature and humidity controlling mechanism.
