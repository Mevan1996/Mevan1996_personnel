# Not-Intrusive Real-Time Power Monitor

This is a smart energy meter capable of inferring the appliance level power consumption given the aggregate power consumption for a household setup in real time. Through this project our group aimed at building a low-cost system to reduce the household energy wastage by providing real-time feedback on appliance level power consumption. I contributed by developing the machine learning based algorithm for the task. This included experimenting models such as additive factorial hidden markov models and attention based neural networks. Our group proposed a novel modelling methodology which outperformed the state of the art.
