This is a system to help visually impaired people in their day to day activities specially in shopping. This system can act as a virtual companion of visually impaired person specially during day to day activities such as shopping.
 I contributed by developing a deep learning based algorithm which is capable of identifying  products in a supermarket and convey the information to the person through speech.  [Project Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y69RHEvX8gA)
